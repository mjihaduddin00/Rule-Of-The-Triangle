# Rule-Of-The-Triangle
In this assignment I was tasked with using the keyboard to enter in three numbers (a, b, and c) which would represent the lengths of the sides of the proposed triangle. I then have to determine whether or not the triangle can exist. This was all completed within the Java programming language.
